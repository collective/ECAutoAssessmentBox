# Changes in release 1.4.3 (2013-03-28)

- ECSpooler 1.3.0 returns an exception instead of an errorcode if an error 
  occurs.  This is considered by ECAutoAssessmentBox as well now. 

# Changes in release 1.4.2 (2011-10-07)

- The new field ``Instant Feedback`` for AutoAssessmentBoxes allows teachers
  to decide whether or not the automatic feedback from ECSpooler/backends will
  be shown to students.

- A lot of minor bugfixes regarding the new release of ECSpooler (1.2). 


# Changes in release 1.4.1 (2011-08-14)

- Fixed issue: ImportError: No module named schema.vocabulary


# Changes in release 1.4 (2011-08-10)

- Added compatibility for Plone 4. Plone 3.x support has been dropped.
  Plone 3 users should use ECAutoAssessmentBox 1.1.

- KSS is used to display input fields for a selected backend without 
  loading the whole edit page again.


# Changes in release 1.1 (2009-10-09)

- ECAutoAssessmentBox was completly re-implemented with support for 
  Plone 3.

- ECAutoAssessmentBox is now eggified and uploaded to PyPI.  An old-style 
  tarball distribution is still available at plone.org.


# Changes in release 1.0 (2007-04-16)

- Added check box "Automatically accept assignments" to 
  ECAutoAssessmentBox to automatically move an assignment in state 
  "accepted" if it successfully passed all tests.  (Makes sense for
  backens which return true or false only.)

- Settings for ECSpooler and appropriated backends are now stored as 
  portal properties.  Therefore it is no longer necessary to set up
  spooler and backends after re-install.

- Indicators are now differ depending on the backends result type, 
  i.e., for backends returning True or False an icon will be displayed,
  otherwise the plain result value (e.g., percentage or score.)

- Performance improvements: We are now using portal_catalog where
  possible.
