# Changes in release 1.4 (2011-04-01)

- Added compatibility for Plone 4. Plone 3.x support has been dropped.
  Plone 3 users should use ECAutoAssessmentBox 1.1.x.


# Changes in release 1.1 (2009-10-09)

- ECAutoAssessmentBox was completly re-implemented with support for 
  Plone 3.

- ECAutoAssessmentBox is now eggified and uploaded to PyPI.  An old-style 
  tarball distribution is still available at plone.org.

# Changes in release 1.0 (2007-04-16)

- Added check box "Automatically accept assignments" to 
  ECAutoAssessmentBox to automatically move an assignment in state 
  "accepted" if it successfully passed all tests.  (Makes sense for
  backens which return true or false only.)

- Settings for ECSpooler and appropriated backends are now stored as 
  portal properties.  Therefore it is no longer necessary to set up
  spooler and backends after re-install.

- Indicators are now differ depending on the backends result type, 
  i.e., for backends returning True or False an icon will be displayed,
  otherwise the plain result value (e.g., percentage or score.)

- Performance improvements: We are now using portal_catalog where
  possible.
